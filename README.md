# Discord-Token-Grabber-Proof-of-Concept
A few months ago my cryptocurrency was stolen from my crypto wallet. It is possible that I may have been exploited through discord. I did research and found that exploits can be executed on discord by screen sharing or a bookmarklet containing a payload of malicious code. Since I did not screenshare with anyone, I set out to learn how my discord was exploited using a bookmarklet. I found a github repository documenting bookmarklet exploits and used it to teach me.
The code presented is a finished concept of a bookmarklet that copies a discord token and sends it to the attacker. For practice, the code was obfuscated as well as ecoded in base 64. Ultimately, I found in a recent update, Discord blocks the execution of bookmarklets, meaning I was not exploited in this fashion.

Included is the original and obfuscated code.
